# BluPrnt2.0

We have created a webpage that dynamically creates UML diagrams based on input in a Class Responsibility Collaborator format. This project was created using Javascript.

##How to Use the App

- In the terminal, ```git clone https://github.com/JWKelly29/BluPrnt2.0.```

- In the terminal, cd into ```BluPrnt2.0/```.

- In the terminal ```open index.html```

#Technologies Used

- App uses - Javascript.

- Ajax - used to manipulate the DOM without a complete page refresh.

#Challenges

Working with another code base proved to be quite a challenge. We originally tried to use another diagramming language called 'mermaid'. However, we spent a whole day researching how to get the language to dynamically render without a page refresh. We switched to JS-Sequence-Diagrams as we found the code base easier to understand.
